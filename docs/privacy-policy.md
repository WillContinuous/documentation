Continuous values its visitors' privacy. This privacy policy summarizes what information Continuous might collect from
a "User" (Continuous Visitor, Continuous User or Subscriber User), and what Continuous will and will not do with it.

Please note that this privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that Continuous
does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by Continuous. If User visits a website that Continuous
mentions or links to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information.

##What Continuous do with User personally identifiable information

It is always up to User whether to disclose personally identifiable information to Continuous, although if User elects
not to do so, Continuous reserves the right not to register User as a user or provides User with any products or
services. "Personally identifiable information" means information that can be used to identify User as an individual,
such as, for example:

- your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address, and shipping address
- your Continuous Services user ID
- any account-preference information User provide us
- your computer's domain name and IP address, indicating
- where your computer is located on the Internet
- session data for your login session, so that our computer can 'talk' to yours while User are logged in

If User does provide personally identifiable information to Continuous, either directly or through a reseller or other
business partner, Continuous will:

- not sell or rent it to a third party without your permission â€” although unless User opts out (see below), Continuous
may use your contact information to provide User with information Continuous believes User needs to know or may find
useful, such as (for example) news about our services and products and modifications to the Terms of Service;
- take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration and destruction;
- not use or disclose the information except:
  - as necessary to provide services or products User has ordered, such as (for example) by providing it to a carrier
  to deliver service User has ordered;
  - in other ways described in this privacy policy or to which User has otherwise consented;
  - in the aggregate with other information in such a way so that User identity cannot reasonably be determined
  (for example, statistical compilations);
  - as required by law, for example, in response to a subpoena or search warrant;
  - to outside auditors who have agreed to keep the information confidential;
  - to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale or disposition of all
  or a portion of Continuous's assets. The successor organization's use and disclosure of your personally-identifiable
  information will continue to be subject to this privacy policy unless (i) a court orders otherwise, for example a
  bankruptcy court; or (ii) the successor organization gives User notice that your personally-identifiable information
  will be subject to the successor organization's own privacy policy, along with an opportunity for User to opt out
  (which may cause User not to be able to continue to use the service). If User submit personally-identifiable
  information after such a transfer, that information may be subject to the successor entity's privacy policy;
  - as necessary to enforce the Terms of Service;
  - as necessary to protect the rights, safety, or property of Continuous, its users, or others; this may include
  (for example) exchanging information with other organizations for fraud protection and/or risk reduction.

If User has questions about deleting or correcting personal data please contact Continuous.

##Other information Continuous collect

Continuous may collect other information that cannot be readily used to identify User, such as (for example) the domain
name and IP address of your computer. Continuous may use this information, individually or in the aggregate, for
technical administration of our service(s); research and development; customer and account administration; and to help
us focus our marketing efforts more precisely.

##Cookies

Continuous Services use "cookies" to store personal data on your computer. Continuous may also link information stored
on your computer in cookies with personal data about specific individuals stored on our servers. If User sets up its
web browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Firefox) so that cookies are not allowed, User might not be able to use
some or all of the features of our website(s).

##Changes to this privacy policy

Continuous reserves the right to change this privacy policy as Continuous deems necessary or appropriate because of
legal compliance requirements or changes in our business practices. If User has provided us with an email address,
Continuous will endeavor to notify User, by email to that address or by a website notification, of any material change
to how Continuous will use personally identifiable information.
